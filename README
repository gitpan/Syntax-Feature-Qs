NAME
    Syntax::Feature::Qs - Trim whitespace from all lines

SYNOPSIS
        use syntax 'qs';

        say qs{
            Multi line
            string
        };

        # is exactly the same as

        say q{
        Multi line
        string
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This is a syntax extension to be used with syntax.

    It provides two quote-like operators, "qs" and "qqs". They are drop-in
    replacements for "q" and "qq", respectively.

    Their purpose is to automatically trim leading and trailing horizontal
    whitespace on every line. They do not remove empty lines.
